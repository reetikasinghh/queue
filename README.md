# queue

Aim: The aim of the given code is to implement a queue data structure using a class and demonstrate its functionality, including enqueueing, dequeueing, and displaying elements in the queue.

Theory: The code defines a class named "Queue" to represent a queue data structure. It uses an array to store elements and provides methods for enqueuing (adding) elements, dequeuing (removing) elements, and displaying the elements in the queue. The code also defines constants for ERROR and the maximum size of the queue.

Algorithm:

Define the constants ERROR and MAXSIZE for error handling and queue size.
Define a class named "Queue" with private data members for front, rear, an array to store elements, and size.
Initialize the front and rear to -1 in the constructor to indicate an empty queue.
Implement the EnQueue method to add an element to the queue:
a. Check if the rear has reached the maximum size (overflow condition).
b. If not, check if it's the first element being added, and if so, update the front.
c. Increment the rear and add the element to the array.
Implement the DeQueue method to remove an element from the queue:
a. Check if the queue is empty (underflow condition).
b. If not, dequeue the element at the front and increment the front.
c. Return the dequeued element or an error value if the queue is empty.
Implement the Display method to show the elements in the queue:
a. Check if the queue is empty.
b. If not, iterate through the elements in the array from front to rear and display them.
In the main function, create a Queue object "q1."
Enqueue the elements 10 and 20 into the queue.
Dequeue an element from the queue and store it in the variable "v."
Display the remaining elements in the queue.
The code demonstrates the queue's functionality by enqueuing, dequeuing, and displaying elements.  

Conclusion: This code successfully implements a basic queue data structure using a class and demonstrates its key operations. It handles cases of queue overflow and underflow and provides an example of enqueuing, dequeuing, and displaying elements. The code is a simple example of how queues work and can be used as a basis for more complex queue-based applications.
